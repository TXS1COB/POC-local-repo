# POC-local-repo
Python scripts to orchestrate data ingestion, extraction, cleansing and curation on prefect.
Sensor-data operatons.py takes a csv file and prepares a clean csv file(metadata removed from original csv file), a parquet file(metadata is added here) and a json file to store the metadata.
